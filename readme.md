#### Creating a platform where money and value move more freely.

## Problem statement

Companies struggle with traditional payroll systems that delay employee compensation until the end of the month, impacting employee satisfaction and financial stability. To modernize payroll, there is a need for a decentralized, real-time solution that enables companies to automatically pay all employees on an hourly basis, providing immediate and transparent compensation, reducing financial stress, and improving overall workforce morale.
